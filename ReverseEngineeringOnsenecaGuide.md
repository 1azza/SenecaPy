# Welcome to my senecalearning.com reverseing guide!

So far I have three ways of cheating on this website:
1. Manipulating the html elements with a js bookmarklet
2. Gaining acsess to the api where the answers are stored and parsing them
3. Connecting to th website via a websocket and sending false information



> HTML METHOD
1. Make js script to locate hidden words on the page
2. Make the script change the class of the word from blurred to none
3. Find the hidden answer and copy using clipboard api
4. ez
> API METHOD
1. Iterate through window.perfomance.logs()
2. Find one equal to 144 characters long this should be the right url
3. Make a reuqest to this adress and it should respond with another url
4. Make a request to this url
5. That was the east bit
6. Now spend weeks making a script to parse it
7. Done

> WEBSOCKET METHOD 
1. Still in progress
